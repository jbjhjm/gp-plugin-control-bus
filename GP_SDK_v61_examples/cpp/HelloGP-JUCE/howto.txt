This is an example of building a GP External Library using the JUCE framework.

Assuming that you installed JUCE and have the Projucer:
- Open the .jucer project in Projucer.
- Click Save project to generate all the project files
- Open your project in XCode / VS etc.. and build
- Copy the generated library to the appropriate GP Library folder.

* IMPORTANT:  Your own library is implemented in the LibMain.h file of each library. 
*             You do not need to change any other files except adjust paths in the .jucer file
